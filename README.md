# Plastic-Recycling-Codes


Resin codes were developed in 1988, by The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI), to help standardize the materials used in different plastic products. Plastic products that are labeled with a resin identification code can be more easily identified and recycled or disposed of accordingly.

The types are:
1- Polyethylene Terephthalate PETE	
2- High Density Polyethylene HDPE
3- Polyvinyl Chloride PVC
4- Low Density Polyethylene LDPE
5- Polypropylene PP	
6- Polystyrene PS
7- Other

To better understand your product options and disposal options, EBP can help you develop a foodservice program that benefits your business' bottom line and the environment.

EBP and other Imperial Dade locations have a variety of recyclable food service options to meet your facility's budget, needs, and demands, whether you're located in the United States, Puerto Rico, or the Caribbean
